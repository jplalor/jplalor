I&rsquo;m ****John Lalor****.
I am an Assistant Professor at the [Mendoza College of Business](https://mendoza.nd.edu) at the [University of Notre Dame](https://www.nd.edu).
I completed my Ph.D. at the University of Massachusetts Amherst in the [College of Information and Computer Science](https://cics.umass.edu).
At UMass I was a member of the Bio-NLP group, working with Dr. Hong Yu.
My research interests are in Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing.
I am particularly interested in model evaluation, quantifying uncertainty, and biomedical informatics.
