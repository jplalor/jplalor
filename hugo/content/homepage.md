I am an Assistant Professor at the [Mendoza College of Business][mendoza] at the [University of Notre Dame][nd]. 
I recently defended my Ph.D. dissertation at the University of Massachusetts Amherst in the [College of Information and Computer Science][cics]. 
At UMass I was a member of the [Bio-NLP][bionlp] group, working with Dr. Hong Yu. 
My research interests are in Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing. 
I am particularly interested in model evaluation and quantifying uncertainty, as well as applications in biomedical informatics.

Prior to UMass, I worked as a software developer at [Eze Software][eze] in Chicago and as an IT Audit Associate for [KPMG][kpmg]. 
I received my Master's Degree in Computer Science at [DePaul University][depaul], where I worked on projects in Computer Science Education and Recommender Systems.
