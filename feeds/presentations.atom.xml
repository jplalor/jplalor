First off, it was a huge help in getting ready for the presentation, I was still very nervous but the tips in the slides were a big help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing that struck me was the slide on Being Heard.
Specifically, trying to identify a &lt;em&gt;nodder&lt;/em&gt; and speaking to him or her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I never thought about it before, but I am definitely a nodder when I attend talks. 
My head is constantly bobbing as I listen to speakers present their work.
So keep an eye out for me if I'm attending your talk, I'll be nodding away!&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry></feed>
