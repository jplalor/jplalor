title: "Feedback"
---

By my count, there are three ways to get new information or make a change related to something you're working on:

1. Order: Your boss can tell you to change something.
2. Advice: "You should try it this way..."
3. Feedback: What do you like/dislike about the current process?

The difference between 2 and 3 is a big one (item 1 is what it is). 
If someone is giving specific advice, I often find it hard to take it. 
But if I get feedback about something that is not working, then I can go back to the drawing board, consider a variety of options, and make a change to address the issue.
