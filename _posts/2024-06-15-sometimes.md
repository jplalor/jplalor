Sometimes it's tough to check a box. 

Maybe you're traveling, with a bunch of tired kids, done of whom get sick in the car. 
As a hypothetical. 
But checking the box, putting the X on the calendar, whatever your metaphor, maintains momentum. 
Even if it's not your most engaged day, it's a success.
