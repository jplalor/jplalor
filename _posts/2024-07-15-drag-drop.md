With prediction getting cheaper and cheaper, there is more RPG-ification of day-to-day life. 
Decisions being outsourced to AI means that decisions are being outsourced to dice. 
These models are estimating probabilities and acting upon them. 
In a way, we are too when we make our own decisions, but it's good to keep this in mind explicitly. 

So in a way, we're pulling out our own internal logic and dropping in the AI randomness, in a form of drag-and-drop stochasticity.
