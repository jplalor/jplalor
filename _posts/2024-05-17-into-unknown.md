title: "Into the Unknown"

Here at ND, it's graduation weekend. 

Seniors heading out to the world after 4 years with Our Lady. 
I wonder how many commencement addresses *over time* have used the phrase "unprecedented time." 
There might be a lot of them this year, but are there every year? 
We're always pushing forward, and to graduate into a time that isn't unprecedented would be stagnation, no?
