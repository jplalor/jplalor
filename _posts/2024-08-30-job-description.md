title: "Job Description"
---

Seth Godin had an interesting post recently on [writing](https://seths.blog/2024/08/non-professional-writers/).

Non-professional writers now have "a new option" beyond improving on writing: using GenAI. 
So the question is: where does a tenure-track professor fall on the professional/non-professional writer split?
I would argue that professional-quality writing is a key part of the job description. 
Our currency is ideas. 
Research papers are our deliverables, so honing the craft of creating them involves writing. 
And on the teaching side, better writing can facilitate clearer communication.
