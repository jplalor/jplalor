title: "First Day"

It's the first day of class at ND. 
Since my teaching is condensed into the fall, this is my first time teaching since last December. 

I like the research-teaching split by semester, but it also puts a lot of pressure on the end of summer, to get certain things wrapped up before I get back in the classroom.
