title: "Workplaces"

I've written a few times about borrowing from manual/industrial jobs to inform knowledge work. 
But there are also key differences. 

One benefit of knowledge work is that you *don't* necessarily have a job site. 
This often gets framed as a negative, in the sense that you can work from anywhere. 

But that also means that if inspiration strikes when you aren't "at work," you can still take action and do something that has potential benefit. 
You can send yourself an email, or jot down a note on your phone.
On the other hand, you can't just build a quick chair when you're out because you had a spark for the right way to secure an arm to the frame.
