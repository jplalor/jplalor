Pre-LLMs, huge amounts of data were generated and left unread/unheard/unseen. 
Or only seen by a small handful of individuals.
 
Now, web content ingested by LLMs is "seen" by these models, and these models are used by huge numbers of people. 
So as a content creator, can you claim that you have that reach, if ChatGPT would not be able to garner that reach without your content? 
It's an inverse tragedy of the commons.
