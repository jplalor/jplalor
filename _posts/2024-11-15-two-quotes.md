title: "Two Quotes"
---

I came across two quotes from different perspectives that I found very interesting by themselves and when paired together.

> As a scientist, you are a professional writer.
>
> - [Joshua Schimel via Jan Recker](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/michaelrosemann_as-a-scientist-you-are-a-professional-writer-activity-7262682938578714624-vHBw/)


> Each day is about showing up, building things, breaking them down, experimenting, and surprising ourselves.
>
> -Rick Rubin, The Creative Act: A Way of Being

I really like the parallels here. 
Jan bringing up this quote to emphasize the importance of writing, a fundamentally creative act, to research. 
And Rick Rubin talking about breaking things down and experimenting: some of the core tenents of research!
