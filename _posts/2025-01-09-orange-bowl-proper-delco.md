Notre Dame vs. Penn State and the Philadelphia connection.

Philly media has a lot to say about tonight's game between Notre Dame and Penn State. 
Penn State is huge in the area. 
But there are also a lot of Irish fans in and around Philly, whether alumns, subway alumns, or other connections. 

I've got a few dogs in this fight: the obvious ones of being an ND alum and working there now.
But that's not all.
My beloved Delco, [Delaware County](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Irish_Americans_in_Philadelphia#Demographics), has a huge number of Irish, by heritage (my mom) and also ex-pats (my dad).
Havertown in Delaware County, PA has been called Ireland's 33rd county. 

GO IRISH!
