title: "Timing"

For a while I had a nice daily blogging practice. 

Then we had a baby, and class started, and we were in dumpster fire mode. 
A lot of habits fell off to the side, including the daily writing. 
I'll revisit it as we establish a new normal. 
Whether daily is the right frequency or not is TBD.
