title: "Confession: I'm a Nodder"
---

I was preparing my slides for my recent MLFL talk, and I came across this great page on [How to give a great presentation][1] by Simon Peyton Jones at MSR.
First off, it was a huge help in getting ready for the presentation, I was still very nervous but the tips in the slides were a big help. 

One thing that struck me was the slide on Being Heard.
Specifically, trying to identify a *nodder* and speaking to him or her.

I never thought about it before, but I am definitely a nodder when I attend talks. 
My head is constantly bobbing as I listen to speakers present their work.
So keep an eye out for me if I'm attending your talk, I'll be nodding away!
