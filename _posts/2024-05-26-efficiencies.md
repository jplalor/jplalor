title: "Efficiencies"
---

Technological development is great for increasing efficiency.
There are pros and cons to this.

More efficient usually means more productive; this is a good thing. 

What about consumer technology? 
Do we want to be maximally efficient in our personal life?
I don't think so. 

Embrace inefficiencies as opportunities to get bored, to let your thoughts wander, to practice gratitude.
Connect with those around you without a goal in mind; instead, simply enjoy their company. 

Happy Sunday.
