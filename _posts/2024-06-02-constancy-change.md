title: "Constancy of Change"

Behind the scenes, things are improving. 

It may not seem like it, but the "release cycle" on just about everything has gone down. 
Think about waterfall software development, where a major software release was rare, touched every piece of a product, and lead to significant amount of re-learning to use the new version. 

Compare that with agile development, where faster, more incremental releases mean more features faster, and more minor modifications so that users can adjust in realtime. 

Do you know how many versions of GPT-4 there have been? 
When is the last time you had an app update that you explicitly remmeber?
They do some regular releases and re-toolings, but under the hood there are incremental changes all the time. 
They will still do big "number" releases for the marketing effect, but these products are constantly changing.
That usually means improvement, but it also means that you need to stay on top of it.
