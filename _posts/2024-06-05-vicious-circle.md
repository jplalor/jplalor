Every day, [hundreds of petabytes](https://edgedelta.com/company/blog/how-much-data-is-created-per-day) of data are created. 

With generative AI coming online, those numbers will skyrocket. 
GenAI can generate data faster and cheaper than humans. 
Let's not forget data generated by Internet of Things devices. 
Machine-generated data outweighing human-generated data makes for an interesting future of the Internet. 
Especially when you consider that future data-hungry GenAI models will need more and more web data to train to keep up with scaling laws. 
We'll have models trained to generate data for models, pulling humans out of the data-generation loop.
