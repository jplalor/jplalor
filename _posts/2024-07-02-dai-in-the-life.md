Here is a little thought experiment, in two parts.

Consider *everything* that happens between when you wake up in the morning and when you fall asleep at night.
This includes what you say, see, feel, do, etc.[^1]

1. How much of your day-to-day can *at this moment* be replaced or replicated by AI? More concretely, if you assume that all of your day-to-day actions and activities originate from some neurons firing in your brain, what percentage of that neuron firing can be offloaded to AI?
2. What is the upper bound on this percentage? Or is there one? And at what point does a person pump the breaks so that they can retain control?




[^1]: You can slim this down if you would like, a la Pixar's Ratatouille, and say that the AI only controls movement.
