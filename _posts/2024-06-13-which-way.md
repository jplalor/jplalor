In some cases, more standardization is better. 
Every DMV in a state can operate under the same specific rules. 
In other cases, more personalization is better. 
My Netflix queue will look different than yours.

If they want standardization, perhaps good old-fashioned analytics (GOFA), or good old-fashioned search (GOFS) is what they really need.
