title: "Tracking Progress"
---

If feedback is slow in coming for your position, here is an interesting exercise to try.

Look at your resume/CV from a few years ago. 
Compare that to your resume/CV today. 
Even if each day, it feels like you are not moving things forward, over time the wins add up. 
In particular, you may have items that were "in progress" from a few years ago that have been completed.
For academics, those papers that were "in the pipeline" are now hopefully in later rounds of review or accepted and published. 

Every once in a while, it's good to zoom out and take a holistic look at work. 
You can get so in the weeds that you're tangled, and forget what the big picture is and why you're working towards it.
