title: "Parts and Wholes"
---

Today I was going to write a short post about the phrase "the whole is more than the sum of its parts."
However, when I went to look it up, I learned that it is actually a misquote! 
It's a mashup of two quotes.

The first, from Aristotle ([source](https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2016/entries/aristotle-metaphysics/#UnitReco)):

> the totality is not, as it were, a mere heap, but the whole is something besides the parts

The second, from Euclid ([source](https://mathcs.clarku.edu/~djoyce/java/elements/bookI/cn.html)):

> The whole is greater than the part

I've learned something today. 
Which makes it a good day. 

I like considering these two quotes together, though, now that I've found them.
The whole being both greater than the part (**singular**) and besides the parts (**plural**) is an interesting pairing. 
Collecting parts together into "a mere heap" gives you quantitatively more stuff, but functionally you just have the same pieces, in a new location. 
But some whole that is not a mere heap is giving you something that is not quite an amalgamation of the parts. 
It may be hard to say a priori if it is better or worse, more or less, from a functional or metaphysical perspective.
But it is "besides the parts."
It is different.
