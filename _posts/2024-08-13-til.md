title: "TIL"

Today I learned (TIL) a new thing!

Specifically, on my Android GMail app, if I swipe my profile picture up, then I can switch between accounts. 
Before, I would click the photo, and explicitly click a different account to switch.
This led to some fat-fingering, where I would open up "suggested actions" or other menus that are decidedly not my inbox. 
Ironically, I would not have learned this new thing without a fat fingering. 

I wonder...

I can see a use case for AI as a feature suggester. 
"Hey, you switch between accounts a lot, but do not use this handy-dandy shortcut. Why don't you give it a try?"
