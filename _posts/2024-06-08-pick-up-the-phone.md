title: "Pick up the Phone"

If your sink leaks, you call a plumber.
If your power goes out, an electrician. 

If your internet goes out, you call your ISP.
And more often than not, you get an automated system. 
The scale of operations means that the internet company has to handle more calls than your local plumber. 
That also means that they employ more automation where they can to make their lives easier and more efficient. 

Now, consider AI. 
In theory, ChatGPT has a customer base with no upper limit.
Here I'm defining customer as "entity that uses ChatGPT outputs."
This includes individuals but also websites, other AI, and connected devices via IoT. 
With that many customers to deal with, who you gonna call when something goes wrong? 
And will you get a human on the other end?
Or an automated message where you select from options?
Or an AI, not disclosing itself, simulating a human operator?
