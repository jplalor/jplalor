The lines between research and industry in AI are a bit blurry at the moment. 

Companies are trying to sell products by touting state-of-the-art performance on research benchmarks.

We don't know because the firms are keeping it close to the vest. 

It's tricky, then, to really clearly identify novel scientific contributions.
