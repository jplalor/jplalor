More diversity!

I want to see more variety on AI safety boards and committees.
Give me some carpenters, some financial folks, some people who know very little about AI. 
I want those involved to have to explain the technology to a layperson so that they can sufficiently assess the risk without having some baked in priors.  
Folks have a lot of priors when it comes to this technology, so it'd be nice to see what people who are not in the thick of it every day think.
