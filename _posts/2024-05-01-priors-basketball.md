In a situation with a high probability of failure (losing to the Knicks and being eliminated from the playoffs), Sixers guard Tyrese Maxey took a low probability shot.

What happened?

Overtime.
The Sixers won. 
Game 6 is Thursday night. 

Low probability doesn't mean impossible. 
High probability doesn't mean inevitable. 
Even if it looks like you only have a 5% chance of success, not taking action automatically drops that to a 0% chance.

Don't consider that as acting against the odds. 
Instead, see numbers like these for what they are: prior probabilities based on the existing, observable information at hand.
Then take action accordingly, update your beliefs based on the outcomes, and continue on.
