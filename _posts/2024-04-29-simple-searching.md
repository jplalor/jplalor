title: "Simple Searching"
---


Pretty soon, we may see hierarchical decision fatigue with regards to AI.

- **Level 1**: which GPT should I choose? This could come at the vendor and/or specific model choice.
- **Level 2**: What if I don't like my answer? Should I tune my prompt and try again until I get the answer I want? 

At what point will an end user get frustrated and take the first option they're given, or opt-out of the process altogether?

Iterating on a design is critical for refining ideas and making a better product.
But users won't want to iterate when what they are trying to do is effectively "smart search."
The cognitive costs to them are too high.
