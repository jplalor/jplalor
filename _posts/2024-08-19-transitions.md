title: "Transitions"

The fall semester starts soon.

Our year is marked by transitions based on the school year. 
The kids go back to school, I go back to teaching. 
That really marks the end of summer for us. 

This year will be another transition on top of the usual with the arrival of the new baby in September. 
I like to use Cal Newport's semester planning to prepare for each new season.
The plan almost always goes sideways, but it helps to have spent the time thinking beyond tomorrow.
