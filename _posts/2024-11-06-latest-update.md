I got back from Amsterdam yesterday after a wonderful (but short) visit to the University of Amsterdam. 

They hosted a [workshop](https://wai-amsterdam.github.io/) discussing new perspectives on bias in NLP.
The trip was very short, and kind of had to be given the baby and my teaching schedule, but I'm very glad I made it happen. 
It was a great chance to present and also get to meet and talk with researchers in this area. 

The fall has certainly been busy, but in a good way.
