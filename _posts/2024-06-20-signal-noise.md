Digitization is a process. 

Not everything that is important is online.
Online, we are generating more data than every before, and it is being used to do some incredible things.
But, we are also having analog experiences and creating analog things that are not online, and won't be fed into the latest AI training pipelines. 
We can document these analog events, but the digitization would be a poor replica of the original experience. 

For those things that are analog, how can we encode them digitally?
Are they important for eventually modeling general intelligence?
Or, are they exclusively important, and the digital data we are so reliant on is simply a distraction?
