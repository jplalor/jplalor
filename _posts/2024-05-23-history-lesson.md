An experiment with GPT-4o, in screenshots.

Have you seen this picture before?

If you are familiar with this picture, then no explanation is really needed.
But if you are not, then you may wonder what is going on?[^1]

Let's ask the internet!
Specifically, let's ask GPT-4o.

Ok, not bad.
Two Irish rugby players.
But this is extremely general.
We want detail.
Why, *specifically*, are the two men in this picture so emotional?

![text](/assets/2024-05-23/annotated2.png)

Incorrect.
And yet, so confident. 

It took two more chances for GPT-4o to identify the match in question.
For context, Ireland played 13 test matches in the 2007 calendar year.

Here we go.
But it took quite a bit of guidance from yours truly.
If I didn't know the context of this picture, I would think that two of the greatest Irish rugby players of all time were so emotional because they lost to Argentina and were eliminated from the Rugby World Cup.
Instead, let's see if we can find out why they were so emotional.

Ah.

A bit more intense, emotionally, than losing a rugby match.

But let's dig a little deeper, shall we?

Wrong.
Wrong. 
And wrong again.

Ireland's Call and God Save the Queen *were* played around when this picture was taken, during the pre-match anthems. 
And The Fields of Athenry is sung at Irish rugby matches by Ireland supporters.
But when the picture was taken, it was Amhr√°n na bhFiann, the Irish national anthem. 

Lastly, just for laughs...they say a picture is worth a thousand words.
The word count of GPT-4o's journey here: 906 words. 
And I would say we've barely scratched the surface.

Maybe 1000 words isn't enough?
