In the future there will be a sizeable market for digital authentication. 
Once they figure out how to do it, the value of digital authenticity will drive creators and consumers to value authenticity in their digital content. 

Blockchain is supposed to be that mechanism, but NFTs didn't really hit the mark. 
Even though *everyone* can see a blockchain and verify a transaction, *almost everyone* doesn't want to. 
They would rather have that work done by a trusted third party, so that when they make a digital purchase they can do so with peace of mind. 
Or when they choose to support a digital artist, they can ensure that their support is going to a particular type of craft. 

So you'll see organizations to certify art, literature, etc. as "GenAI free," or you'll have organizations that require a full audit trail of how content was generated before they are willing to put their stamp on it. 

But we're a long way off from that. 
Right now it is very much the wild west out there.
