Consider the following three queries.
Something behind the scenes is triggering Gemini.
Should the end user have a say about whether they want *vintage* Google (web search) or a GenAI output?

1. "[What are the Olympics](https://www.google.com/search?q=what+are+the+olympics)?"
2. "[Olympics](https://www.google.com/search?q=olympics)"
3. "[Define Olympics](https://www.google.com/search?q=define+olympics)"

Queries 1 and 3 provide an "AI overview" on Google, while query 2 does not. 

Let's do it again!

1.  "[Who are the Philadelphia Phillies](https://www.google.com/search?q=who+are+the+philadelphia+phillies)?"
2.  "[Philadelphia Phillies](https://www.google.com/search?q=philadelphia+phillies)"
3.  "[Define Philadelphia Phillies](https://www.google.com/search?q=define+philadelphia+phillies)"
