If [AI replaces architects](https://www.ncarb.org/blog/ai-enhancer-the-architect-not-a-replacement), who will the contractors yell at? 

More seriously, a lot of what is proposed for improving architectural workflows using AI pulls the architect further away from the jobsite. 
This is not necessarily a good thing. 
While it may be more efficient, sometimes you need to walk the site and compare the digital to the physical.
