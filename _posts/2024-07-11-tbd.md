When will I be able to type the following into a chat box and have it just handle it:

> Build a new house for me. 

Think about all of the humans required to get that done. 
Would the AI just need to be the project manager, coordinating humans? 
Or could this request be handled by a network of technologies that keep humans out of the loop?
