title: "The Paragraph of Theseus"
---


Imagine: you are writing something in Word (or Google Docs). Doesn't really matter what. 
In your open window, you receive a popup:

> We have suggestions to improve this paragraph, would you like to use them?

You click yes.

You get the same popup for the newly crafted paragraph.
You click yes again. 

Repeat this process some number of times. 
Who wrote the resulting paragraph? 

And does it matter?
