title: "Keeping Tabs"
---

It's not always enough to track things.

KPIs, daily habits, etc.
Revisiting those metrics and learning from what has been recorded is key.
It's almost like a personal data analytics exercise.

What trends can you identify?
Are there patterns around state of mind, days of the week, "unexpected emergencies" that keep popping up?
By not only teaching but also evaluating you can learn so much more about yourself and your routines. 
You don't need to build a model to predict yourself, but it's nice to have some insider information on yourself.
