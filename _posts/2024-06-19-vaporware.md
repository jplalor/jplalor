Is AGI vaporware? 

If the goalposts keep moving, how will we know when we've got AGI? 
The goalposts could move up ("We did it!"), but will it have been delivered, or just overpromised and overhyped?
The goalposts could move back ("Winning chess isn't AI, winning Go is"), but then AGI will never be achieved, and we will have been promising it, investing in it, worrying about it for so long. 

Maybe we can first define it.
