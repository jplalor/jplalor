title: "Good or Correct"
---

Are correct and good the same thing? 

Correct is binary. 
An answer is judged against some known entity and it is decided whether they match (correct) or not (incorrect). 
On the other hand, good exists on a continuum.
Something might be bad and correct, or good but incorrect. 
It could be pretty good, or good enough, but we don't know if it is correct. 
Do you need something to be good, correct, or both?
