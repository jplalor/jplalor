title: "Be Ready"
---

You don't know when your moment in the spotlight will come. 
Or if it will come at all.
But when it does come, you need to be ready. 

Ready in two senses.
First, you need to have done the work ahead of time to be prepared to execute. 
Second, you need to be ready to adapt, because the rush of attention, fans, or resources may not happen the way that you prepared for. 
It's not enough to simply be ready.
You must also be ready to go with the flow. 
And if that involves a new expense, or a dramatic change from the plan, be ready to pay up. 
Getting that moment right could mean the difference between a huge jump up for your company, brand, image. 
Getting it wrong might get you in a case study of what not to do when the light shines brightest.
