There is a time for careful planning, and there is a time for execution.

There are cases when every detail must be considered and mastered, and there are cases where you learn as you go. 
Experimentation is great and can lead to wonderful innovation, but there are also times when it's necessary to do things "by the book." 
Learning and understanding the differences is key. 
Because once you have those down, then you can start to play with the rules.
In writing, the best writers are those that have mastered the rules so that they can manipulate them in the service of their creative goals. 
In knowledge work, understanding what type of planning and execution is required for a given task allows the flexibility to be creative on the specific solution within the framework. 
It also gives you the chance to think about whether this is a time to go against what had been the typial way of doing things.
