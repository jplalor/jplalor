title: "Toleficiation"
---

Herb Simon coined the term satisficing to describe a scenario when a "good enough" solution is chosen instead of an optimal solution.

One thing that we're seeing at the moment is a type of digital satisficing, but it's more like an anti-satisficing. 
The solution provided by some digital tools is often neither *satisfying* nor is it *sufficient*. 
This could be in part due to the decision space. 
Traditionally, there is an optimal solution, it just cannot be reached fast enough or cheaply enough for it to be viable in a satisficing model. 
Is there an optimal solution for "task management?" 
What about "email"?
Or, looking at something a little closer to the economic realm, how does one satisfice when it comes to using digital tools to foster innovation in a team? 

Instead of satisficing, people are *tolefying* their digital tools. 
They *tolerate* the current solution, and *justify* their usage even if the product does not provide a solution for them with the expectation that it will get figured out or fixed later.
