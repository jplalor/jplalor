title: "Dean Wormer, the SE"

Let categories be categories. 

Something that I'm not a huge fan of: *risky* and *highly risky* major revisions at journals. 
The typical categories (excluding Accept) are "Minor Revision," "Major Revision," and "Reject."
But I'm seeing more editors placing qualifiers in their letters around what kind of Major Revision the work might be.
Let Major mean *major*, as in it will take a lot of work. 
It reminds me of [a scene in Animal House](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f4MkCJiDoNk), when Dean Wormer places the Delta fraternity on "double secret probation."
If you have to tell an author team that they have an *extremely risky major revision* on their hands, maybe just reject the paper? 
Or tell them they have a major revision, and lay out what you would expect them to do.
They can see that it is a lot of steps.
