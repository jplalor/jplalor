title: "Good, Better, Best"

Is X better than Facebook? 
The question doesn't make sense unless the parameters of comparison are set.

Are we talking about user experience? 
If so, in what way? 
Adding connections, keeping up with friends, getting the latest news? 
Or are we asking from a technical perspective?
Which has better uptime metrics, cleaner code, etc.?

Asking a more specific question will get you closer to your answer.
