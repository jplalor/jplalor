title: "Slow AI"

Slow food, slow productivity, what about slow AI?

AI is moving so fast right now. 
Part of that is the fact that a lot of things are being placed under the AI umbrella. 

Perhaps we would do well to slow it down. 
More specifically, slow down what gets to be under the AI umbrella. 
When you develop a new product or solution, you should have to define it wihtout saying AI. 
Then, once all of the details have been explained, a determination can be made as to whether this is AI. 

Now, this obviously isn't going to happen in any wide sense.
But you can try to slow down on what you see and do with AI until its benefits are clear.
