title: "Turning Points"
---

People often align behavior change to dates or events.
A new year, a birthday, even the beginning of a new week can act as a catalyst for change. 

In theory, January 1 is just another day.
Perhaps it shouldn't have this outsized proportion of resolutions, changes, etc. 
However, instead of arguing against New Year's Day and other such "turning points," what if we can expand the scope?
What would it take to make every day a possible turning point? 
What kinds of changes can I make to my schedule, routine, or plans that prime every day as a day full of possibilities?
Full of potential for change and growth?
