title: "What are you Asking?"

Google is rolling out GenAI responses to search results. 
That got me thinking. 

What is the point of google.com? 
I don't mean that to be difficult.
Seriously, why do you go to google.com?

It could be for a number of reasons. 
You could be looking for specific content on a specific website, such as movie showtimes, store hours, inventory availability, or your favorite team's next game. 
On the other hand, you may be looking for information that doesn't have as clear of a correct answer. 

*What should I do about my kid who isn't sleeping*? or *How do I deal with a problem at work*?

These types of questions cannot be answered by an information retrieval model like what is under the hood of "traditional" google.com. 
But GenAI can at least can engage with the question in a way that more traditional models cannot. 

What you are asking (*question content*) dictates which model you should engage with to get your question answered.
