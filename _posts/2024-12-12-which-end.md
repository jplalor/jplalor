title: "Two Ears, One Mouth"

I'm using my imagination here, so bear with me. 

At the moment, AI agents via LLMs are very input-heavy.
A user asks ChatGPT to reword his email before sending it to his colleague. 
Or a user asks Gemini to create something from scratch. 

What if the AI agents and LLMs were instead applied to the *outputs*?
For example, I plug an LLM into my inbox so that every email that I read is re-written to be in an uplifting tone. 
Then it doesn't matter what AI the sender used to re-write the text. 
Or I ask my AI to remix a photo from Instagram based on my preferences, and not on the preferences of the creator. 
Think of it like MyAI, where there is extreme personalization.
