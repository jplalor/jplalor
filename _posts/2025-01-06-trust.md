What will anti-trust look like in the future? 
Could this be an example?

Take a look at the responses to the same question from Google's built in AI and ChatGPT's 4o mini.

First, using Google:

And next, from ChatGPT:

Now, if we assume in the future that AI and LLMs will become more like personal operating systems, could it be the case that firms could run into anti-trust trouble by giving responses like Google's above? 
Recall that Microsoft had some [difficulties](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_v._Microsoft_Corp.) around Internet Explorer and Windows. 

Are AI recommendations going to be similar? 
Or more broadly, AI "actions"?
Many of these models are gaining agentic capabilities. 
Will they have to ensure that they are not prioritizing particular vendors for agentic capabilities?
