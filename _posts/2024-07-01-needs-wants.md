title: "Needs or Wants"

Does your firm need AI?

Or does your firm need a clearer strategy?
If you didn't know you needed AI before, what makes you think things have changed so dramatically because of this new technology?
If you can answer this question, and have a justification beyond "because it's *AI*!" then go for it.
If not...

Execute your strategy.
