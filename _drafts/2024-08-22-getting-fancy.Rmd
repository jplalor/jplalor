A test of getting some plots in here. 

I want to use R and the baseballr package to show the standings of the NL East. 


```{r echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}

library(baseballr)

library(baseballr)
library(dplyr)


bref_standings_on_date("2024-08-22", "NL East", from = FALSE) %>%
knitr::kable(format="markdown")

```
