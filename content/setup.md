Summary: How I set this page up with Pelican and GitHub Pages

Here I'm going to write about how I set up this website, using Pelican and GitHub Pages

Why GitHub Pages? It's free
Why Pelican? I know Python and didn't feel like learning Ruby.

Link to [this page for a lot of the intro info][1]

Link to [pelican themes][2] for how to pick a theme and set it up

talk about ghp-import script

next steps: automate ghp-input steps into post commit hook, play with theme, content!
