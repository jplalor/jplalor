I am a PhD candidate at the University of Massachusetts Amherst in the [College of Information and Computer Science][1]. I work with Dr. Hong Yu in the Bio-NLP group. My research interests are in Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing.

Prior to UMass, I worked as a software developer at [Eze Software][2] in Chicago and as an IT Audit Associate for [KPMG][23]. I received my Master's Degree in Computer Science at [DePaul University][3], where I worked on projects in Computer Science Education and Recommender Systems. I received my bachelor's degree in IT Management from [Universty of Notre Dame][9], with a minor in Irish Language & Literature.

#Projects

Below are a few projects that I've worked on, either as part of a class project or on my own time.

- [GutenRecs][10]: "More like this" book recommendations for Project Gutenberg. Final Project for ECT 584: Web Data Mining at DePaul
- [An Analysis of Major League Baseball as a Social Network][11]: Final project for CSC 495: Social Network Analysis at DePaul.
- [Goodreads Right Click][12]: A Chrome Extension for Searching on Goodreads. I wanted this to exist, so I built it.
