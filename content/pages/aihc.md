# Description
The first year seminar is intended to be an exploration of computer science for first-year CS majors and exploratory track students where we focus on a single topic. In this section we will discuss artificial intelligence (AI) in healthcare. We will use topics in healthcare to introduce concepts in AI and talk about how different methods in AI have made an impact in healthcare. We will also discuss the topics related to deploying AI models in healthcare, such as interpretability and bias.
