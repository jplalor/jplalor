I am an Assistant Professor at the [Mendoza College of Business](https://mendoza.nd.edu) at the [University of Notre Dame](https://www.nd.edu).
I completed my Ph.D. at the University of Massachusetts Amherst in the [College of Information and Computer Science](https://cics.umass.edu).
At UMass I was a member of the Bio-NLP group, working with Dr. Hong Yu.
My research interests are in Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing.
I am particularly interested in model evaluation, quantifying uncertainty, and biomedical informatics.

Prior to UMass, I worked as a software developer at Eze Software in Chicago and as an IT Audit Associate for KPMG.
I received my Master's Degree in Computer Science at DePaul University, where I worked on projects in Computer Science Education and Recommender Systems.
